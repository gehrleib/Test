Validate that the ERIC 04 job handles mixed scenarios where a single retired 2LOD control is linked to multiple high-level plans. It must delink plans not yet exported to Calma while preserving links to approved, exported plans.

Pre-conditions: Identify a single Active 2LOD control linked to at least two different High Level Plans:

Plan A (Keep): Status is Approved AND Exported to Calma is Yes.

Plan B (Remove): Status is Draft, Review, or Approved AND Exported to Calma is No.

Test Steps:

Retire Control: Change the control status to Retired.

Note: Use QA override to modify control without ORMS workflow.

Execute Job: Run ERIC 04 - A2A - Delink CRCP from CP, CA, and MT.

Verify Links: Inspect the plan associations for the now-retired control.

Expected Result:

Plan A remains linked to the control.

Plan B is delinked from the control.

The system correctly filters based on the "Exported to Calma" flag.
