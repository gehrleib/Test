# Story Title  
**Enforce Comment Requirement for Override of Next Control Test Year in High-Level Plan Submissions**

## Problem Statement  
To satisfy audit requirements, every override of the *Next Control Test Year* field in the High-Level Plan for Monitoring Testing must be associated with a comment.  
Currently, there is no mechanism in place to enforce this requirement, and users can submit overrides without justification, leading to compliance risk and audit issues.

## Proposed Solution  
Due to technical limitations with inline editing, we cannot enforce comment entry at the time of override. Instead, we will introduce the following process enhancements:

1. **For Submitters:**  
   - Allow submission without a comment, but display a warning banner that explains missing comments will result in automatic or reviewer-based rejection.

2. **For Reviewers:**  
   - If a submitted override lacks a comment, a banner will indicate that the submission cannot be approved and must be rejected.  
   - If no reviewer action is taken within the allotted time, the system will auto-reject the submission.  
   - The auto-rejection will include a default reviewer comment explaining the reason for rejection.

## Acceptance Criteria

*1. Banner for Submitter*  
- A clear banner is displayed during submission if any override of the *Next Control Test Year* lacks a comment.  
- The banner explains that the reviewer cannot approve such submissions and will either reject it manually or the system will auto-reject it.

*2. Banner for Reviewer*  
- A clear banner is shown to the reviewer on submissions where an override lacks a comment.  
- The banner informs them they cannot approve and are only allowed to reject the submission.

*3. Auto-Rejection Behavior*  
- If no reviewer action is taken within the specified timeframe, the system auto-rejects the submission.  
- A default reviewer comment is added to the rejection explaining the lack of comment for the override.

*4. Validation Scope*  
- The system correctly detects instances of the *Next Control Test Year (Override)* where no comment is provided.  
- Only those instances trigger the banners and conditional logic.
