Rename Regulatory Theme Checklist (RTC) to Baseline Inherent Risk Rating (BIRR)

---

h3. Description

*Problem Statement:*
The current naming convention, "Regulatory Theme Checklist" (RTC), is outdated and does not align with our new risk methodology, which uses "Baseline Inherent Risk Rating" (BIRR). This inconsistency creates confusion for end-users and hinders the adoption of the new methodology. A comprehensive renaming is required to ensure consistency across the platform.

*Solution:*
We will implement a full-scale renaming of all fields, objects, and tabs related to the Regulatory Theme Checklist to reflect the new Baseline Inherent Risk Rating (BIRR) methodology. This includes front-end user interfaces, back-end data fields, and any associated rules or actions.
