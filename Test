h3. Description

*Problem Statement:*
Currently, when a control is updated, the Local Regulatory Environment Questionnaire (LREQ) is not automatically refreshed. This results in the LREQ containing outdated information that no longer accurately reflects our current control environment. This gap in automation poses a significant compliance risk by failing to align our regulatory assessments with real-time changes, and it creates a manual burden for the compliance team to identify and rectify these discrepancies.

*Solution:*
We will implement an automated trigger that generates a new LREQ for refresh whenever a change to a control is detected. This new trigger will ensure that the LREQ is always in sync with our control environment. This aligns the LREQ generation with existing risk assessment triggers, creating a consistent and reliable process for maintaining up-to-date compliance documentation.

h3. Acceptance Criteria

* *GIVEN* a user has updated and saved changes to a control in the system
* *WHEN* the system detects the change
* *THEN* a new LREQ is automatically generated.
* The newly generated LREQ must be pre-populated with the latest information related to the updated control.
* The system must send a notification to the appropriate regulatory team, alerting them that a new LREQ has been generated for their review.
* The system should log the event, including the control that was changed and the timestamp of the LREQ generation, to ensure traceability and aid in troubleshooting.
