h1. Assessable Unit Snapshot Synchronization

h2. Story
As a compliance officer, I want the Assessable Unit snapshot to accurately reflect the current Assessable Unit record, so that I can rely on historical data for audits and reporting.

----

h2. Description

h3. Problem Statement:
The existing Assessable Unit snapshot has fallen out of sync with recent changes to the Assessable Unit record. This has led to the capture of outdated or incorrect information, making the snapshots unreliable for historical reference and analysis. Specifically:
* The snapshot still captures *Legacy Issues and Findings* instead of the current *EIM* and *NIE* records.
* The snapshot's regulatory content does not correctly reflect the influence of *Norton Rose regulatory content* for *CUBE regulatory content*.
* The tabs on the snapshot do not match the current tabs on the Assessable Unit record (e.g., Assessments, Regulations, etc.).
* The *LED head and delegate submission section* contains separate commentary for overrides, which is no longer in use.

This inconsistency between the live record and the historical snapshot creates a significant data integrity issue.

h3. Solution:
Update the Assessable Unit snapshot process to ensure it accurately reflects the current state of the Assessable Unit record. This will be a multi-part solution:
# *Update Data Capture:* When a new snapshot is created, it must capture *EIM* and *NIE* data instead of the deprecated "Legacy Issues and Findings."
# *Regulatory Content Logic:* Modify the snapshot to correctly display *CUBE* regulatory content as influenced by the *Norton Rose regulatory content*.
# *Layout Synchronization:* Ensure that the tabs on the snapshot mirror the tabs on the live Assessable Unit record. This includes tabs such as *Assessments*, *Regulations*, *Regulatory Theme Checklist*, *Issues and Exceptions*, *Monitoring and Testing*, and *Roles and Responsibilities*.
# *Submission Section Update:* Remove the separate commentary for overrides from the *LED head and delegate submission section* of the snapshot.

h2. Acceptance Criteria
* *Given* an Assessable Unit snapshot is created after Monday, July 21st.
* *When* a user views the snapshot's Issues and Exceptions data.
* *Then* the snapshot must display the records for *EIM* and *NIE*.
* *And* it must not display any "Legacy Issues and Findings."

* *Given* a snapshot of an Assessable Unit with CUBE content is created after July 21st.
* *When* a user views the snapshot's regulatory content.
* *Then* the CUBE regulatory content must reflect the influence of the Norton Rose regulatory content.

* *Given* a new snapshot of an Assessable Unit is taken.
* *When* a user navigates the snapshot.
* *Then* the tabs visible on the snapshot (e.g., Assessments, Regulations, Monitoring and Testing) must be the same as the tabs on the live Assessable Unit record.

* *Given* a new snapshot of an Assessable Unit is taken.
* *When* a user views the LED head and delegate submission section.
* *Then* there must not be any separate commentary fields for overrides.
