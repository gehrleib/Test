Subject: Clarification on Segment and Regulatory Theme Levels in RegComp
Hi Team,
I'm writing to get some clarity on how we're using segment and regulatory theme levels within RegComp, specifically concerning our assessable units and reporting.
As you know, we have three levels for both segments and regulatory themes. However, our standard practice for assessable units and most of our reporting focuses exclusively on Segment Level 1 and Regulatory Theme Level 3.
I understand that we can use the lower levels (2 or 3) to inform our selection for Level 1. My main concern is ensuring consistency in this process. We need to be able to choose the lowest level for every segment.
For example, I'm unsure if the lowest levels for a segment like Human Resources (e.g., compensation, ER governance) are consistently our Level 2 or Level 3. We need to confirm this to maintain a standardized process across all our segments.
Additionally, I'd like to explore the possibility of a display modification within the cube. Is it feasible to display all three levels (1, 2, and 3) but only allow users to select Level 3? This would help us visualize the hierarchy while ensuring we adhere to our reporting standard of using Level 3.
Please let me know your thoughts on this and if you have any suggestions for a solution.
Thanks,
[Your Name]
