*Story Title:* Replace Regulator fields on Exam object with Primary/Additional Regulator fields

---

h3. Description

*Problem Statement:*
We recently replaced our internal regulator list with the "issuing body" from CUBE. The current fields on the Exam object, "Primary Regulator Responsible for Regulation Involved" and "Additional Regulators Responsible for Regulation Involved," still reference the old RCM Regulator list. This inconsistency creates a data gap and prevents us from fully decommissioning the outdated list, which poses a maintenance and data integrity risk.

*Solution:*
We will implement a data migration to replace the existing regulator fields on the Exam object. The field "Primary Regulator Responsible for Regulation Involved" will be replaced by a new field called "Primary Regulator". The field "Additional Regulators Responsible for Regulation Involved" will be replaced by a new field called "Additional Regulators". All existing data will be migrated to the new respective fields, and the old RCM Regulator list will be decommissioned once the migration is complete.
