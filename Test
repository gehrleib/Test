To accommodate both source types, this story requires a consolidated view or two distinct related lists on the **Line of Business Distinct** record.

## Jira Story: View Open EIM Issues and NIE Exceptions on LoB Distinct

**User Story:**
As a Data Administrator, I need to see all open **Enterprise Issue Management (EIM)** records and **Non-Issue Exceptions (NIE)** associated with a **Line of Business Distinct** record. This visibility is required to assess if the Line of Business and its Country combinations can be safely retired.

---

### Technical Requirements

1. **Related List Integration:**
* Add two new related lists to the **Line of Business Distinct** form:
* **Open EIM Issues**
* **Open NIE Exceptions**




2. **Relationship Logic:**
* Configure the lists to traverse the hierarchy: `LoB Distinct`  `Child LoB/Country Combinations`  `Associated Issues/Exceptions`.


3. **Default Filtering:**
* **State Filter:** Filter both lists to exclude terminal states (e.g., exclude "Closed," "Resolved," "Canceled," or "Expired").
* **Source Filter:** Ensure EIM records and NIE records are routed to their respective lists based on their source table or category.

### Acceptance Criteria (AC)

| ID | Criteria | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **AC 1** | **EIM Visibility** | A related list displays all active EIM issues linked to any child LoB/Country record under the Distinct parent. |
| **AC 2** | **NIE Visibility** | A related list displays all active Non-Issue Exceptions (NIE) linked to any child LoB/Country record under the Distinct parent. |
| **AC 3** | **State Enforcement** | Neither list displays closed or inactive records by default. |
| **AC 4** | **Data-Driven Retirement** | Data Administrators can verify "Zero Open Records" across both lists before proceeding with LoB retirement. |

---

### Implementation Notes

* **UI Organization:** If the form becomes too cluttered, consider placing these under a "Retirement Readiness" form section or tab.
* **Count Indicators:** Ensure the related list tabs show a record count (e.g., *Open EIM Issues (3)*) so admins can see the volume without clicking into the tab.

**Would you prefer these as two separate lists for clear distinction, or a single "Open Blockers" list that combines both EIM and NIE records?**
