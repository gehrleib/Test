# Story Title  
**Improve Visibility into Upcoming Assessments and Align Terminology in Risk Assessment UI**

## Problem Statement  
When the Risk Assessment status changes to *Approved*, there is no clear visibility into when the next *Annual Assessment* or the required *Mandatory Risk-Based Review* is due.  
This lack of visibility can result in confusion around scheduling, deadlines, and upcoming compliance requirements.  

Additionally, the current terminology used in the *Off-Cycle Refresh* section is outdated and inconsistent with the updated nomenclature, which leads to further misunderstanding among users.

## Proposed Solution  
1. **Improve Visibility**  
   - Display both the **Next Assessment Date** and the **Mandatory Risk-Based Review Date** above the section currently labeled *Off-Cycle Refresh*.

2. **Terminology Alignment**  
   - Rename the section titled *Off-Cycle Refresh* to **Next Assessment Details**.
   - Rename the action/button currently labeled *Off-Cycle Refresh* to **Perform Off-Cycle Refresh**.

## Acceptance Criteria

*1. Display of Dates*  
- When a Risk Assessment status is *Approved*, the following dates must be displayed prominently above the off-cycle section:
  - **Next Assessment Date**
  - **Mandatory Risk-Based Review Date**

*2. Section Title Update*  
- The section formerly labeled *Off-Cycle Refresh* is renamed to **Next Assessment Details**.

*3. Button Label Update*  
- The button/action currently labeled *Off-Cycle Refresh* is renamed to **Perform Off-Cycle Refresh**.

*4. Data Accuracy*  
- The displayed dates for both the next assessment and risk-based review are pulled from the appropriate data sources and are accurate.

*5. Visibility Conditions*  
- These changes apply only when the Risk Assessment status is *Approved*.
- If status is not *Approved*, the *Next Assessment Details* section and its content should not be displayed.

*6. Consistency Across Views*  
- Updates to labels and display must be reflected consistently in all relevant screens (e.g., summary view, detailed assessment view).
