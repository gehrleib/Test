Acknowledged. I will ignore the "jewelry" typo and record this as a Jira story. Since the solution is a configuration toggle, the story focuses on the fix and ensuring no further notification gaps exist.

## Jira Story: Enable Notifications for Scheduled Data Feed Updates

**User Story:**
As a System Administrator, I need to enable the "Send Notifications" option for the High-Level Plan schedule/data feed to ensure that systemic rejections and updates trigger automated alerts to stakeholders, consistent with user-driven actions.

---

### Technical Requirements

1. **Configuration Update:**
* Locate the **Data Feed / Schedule** configuration associated with the High-Level Plan module.
* Enable the setting: **"Send notifications when records are published or updated via schedule/data feed."**


2. **Verification:**
* Trigger a test systemic rejection via the data feed.
* Verify the outbound notification is generated in the system logs and sent to the appropriate actionees.

### Acceptance Criteria (AC)

| ID | Criteria | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **AC 1** | **Configuration Activation** | The "Send Notifications" toggle is set to `Active` on the relevant schedule/feed record. |
| **AC 2** | **Systemic Trigger** | Automated rejections caused by the data feed successfully trigger the standard rejection notification workflow. |
| **AC 3** | **Consistency** | Notification content for systemic rejections matches the format and recipient logic of user-driven rejections. |
| **AC 4** | **Log Verification** | System logs confirm that the scheduled job is now identified as a valid trigger for the notification engine. |

### Implementation Notes

* **Root Cause:** The incident occurred because the system distinguished between "User Action" and "System Action," with the latter suppressed by the schedule settings.
* **Audit:** Review other critical data feeds (e.g., EIM or NIE feeds) to ensure the same notification setting is enabled where stakeholder awareness is required.

**Would you like me to add a task to audit other active schedules to ensure this setting is consistently applied?**
