Thank you for your email. This message provides guidance on how to proceed with the CUBE data points you raised.

1. Discrepancies in Reg Book & Reg Group Names
For any differences in the Reg Book or Reg Group names, you will need to reach out to CUBE for clarification.

Reg Book Name: Please note that these names are unlikely to be changed by CUBE, as they are standardized for use by other customers.

Reg Group Name: This is managed by our team, so you have the ability to make changes. The variation in a name could be intentional to differentiate it from other similar groups, but if you determine a change is needed, you can make the adjustment directly.

It is worth noting that as this type of review becomes business-as-usual (BAU), we anticipate that CUBE's direct support for such granular inquiries may become more limited.

2. Applicability and Imposing Requirements on RBC
The changes you see in the "Applies to RBC" and "Imposing Requirement" fields were made following a stakeholder request, as Guernsey regulations are no longer applicable to RBC.

The majority of these updates can be cross-referenced with the attached Excel sheet and the "Regulation Mapping Update" email.

While most have been addressed, there may still be some outliers that require further investigation, but this number should be significantly lower now.

The count for "Regulatory Theme" is identical to the "Section Imposes Requirement on RBC" count because they are directly linked. If a section imposes a requirement on RBC, it is assigned a theme; if it does not, no theme is applied.

3. CUBE Live Data vs. Authority Source Data (Missing/Archived Groups)
When a group is marked as 'Archived' or is missing from the CUBE Live Data, it means the group no longer meets CUBE's ingestion criteria. A group is only ingested if it meets the following three conditions:

The group must be active.

There is at least one citation tied to the group.

The group is tied to citations that belong to a single book.

In these cases, the assumption should be that the citations originally tied to the group are no longer valid or active. As a result, CUBE has archived the group because it no longer has any citations associated with it.

I hope this information provides the necessary guidance for your next steps.
