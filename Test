Hi Matthew,
Thanks for your email. Here are the answers to your questions.
Regarding the country filter on the Authority Sources Cube:
The country filter is not available on the initial page of the Authority Sources Cube. This is because the country is tied to the Regulatory Book, not the Issuing Body. By default, our system (RegComp/Archer) only allows filtering at the highest level on the main report view. For more advanced filtering, you would need to go to the "Modify" page. We do have a vendor software update scheduled for early next year, and it's possible this functionality will be included in the new version, but we can't make any promises.
Regarding organizing and grouping pinpoint citations:
The organization and grouping of the pinpoint citations are exactly as they were in the previous Norton Rose system. This was part of the one-to-one mapping exercise we completed. Your request to change this seems to be a modification request and falls under Business As Usual (BAU). Please be aware that any changes to these groups could affect the current mappings to the accessibility units. If you decide to merge groups, you must ensure that those mappings are replicated on the new group to avoid any issues.
