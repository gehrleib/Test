## Jira Story: Retain Data Relationships for Retired Assessable Units

**Summary:** Update Assessable Unit (AU) retirement logic to retain Theme and Line of Business (LoB) associations and enhance UI visibility of AU status.



### User Story

I want retired Assessable Units to maintain their associations with Lines of Business and Themes, so that I can accurately report on and identify historical risk data.



### Acceptance Criteria

| Area | Requirement |
| **Data Retention** | When an Assessable Unit's status is changed to "Retired," the system must **not** nullify or delete the foreign key relationships to `Line of Business` or `Theme`. |
| **LoB View UI** | The Line of Business detail/listing view must display the `Risk Assessment Status` (e.g., Active, Retired, Pending) next to each linked Assessable Unit. |
| **Theme View UI** | The Theme detail/listing view must display the `Risk Assessment Status` next to each linked Assessable Unit. |
| **Filtering** | Views for LoB and Themes should include a toggle or filter to "Show/Hide Retired Units" (Default: Show All or Active-only based on current global UX patterns). |



### Technical Notes

* **Backend:** Modify the `onStatusChange` or `retireAU` service method. Remove the logic that triggers the unlinking of `ThemeID` and `LoBID`.
* **Database:** Ensure no cascading deletes or null-setters are active on these specific relationships during status transitions.
* **Frontend:** Update the AU component used within the LoB and Theme modules to include a status badge or text label.
