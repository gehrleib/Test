Understood. Thank you for the clarification. It seems I misunderstood the context and structured the email as a proposal rather than a descriptive explanation. Here is an updated draft that accurately explains the system's behavior.
Subject: Explanation of Regulatory Citation Structure and Grouping
Hi [Recipient Name],
Following up on our discussion, I wanted to provide a detailed explanation of how the regulatory citation structure works and the logic behind the grouping of citations.
The Cube system has a four-level hierarchy: Issuing Body, Regbook, Reggroup, and Citation. This differs from our previous Norton Rose system, which used a three-level structure: Regulator, Legislation, and Pinpoint Citation.
Here's how the two systems relate:
 * The Issuing Body, Regbook, and Citation fields in Cube are static, as they are part of the core data used by multiple customers.
 * The Reggroup level is where the flexibility lies. It is the equivalent of the old Pinpoint Citation.
In our data, a Reggroup can contain multiple individual Citations. We see this in the data that was brought over from Norton Rose, where citations were already grouped together. For example, a single Reggroup named "12 CFR 8.8" can have multiple citations tied to it.
This grouping logic is based on three key attributes: Applicability, Imposing, and Theme. Citations are merged or combined into a single Reggroup only when these three attributes are identical.
I've attached the example image you provided, which illustrates a Reggroup correctly referencing multiple individual citations.
This structure allows us to maintain a consistent hierarchy while accommodating the reality of how citations are grouped.
Please let me know if you have any questions about this.
Thanks,
[Your Name]
