Personal Development & Skill Enhancement: This year, I successfully achieved my personal learning goals, which were focused on modernizing my development workflow and toolset. I significantly increased my proficiency in Visual Studio Code, improving my development speed through advanced features and shortcuts. More specifically, I focused on mastering its integration with the broader development ecosystem, including GitHub for source control, GitHub Copilot for AI-assisted coding, and GitHub Actions for exploring workflow automation. Adopting these modern tools has directly translated into greater personal productivity and efficiency in my daily tasks.
