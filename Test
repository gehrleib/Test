Acknowledged. Since the decommissioning is handled via a status change to "Inactive," the focus shifts to communication and report maintenance.

## Jira Story: Deactivate Legacy 1LOD and 2LOD Fields

**User Story:**
As a System Administrator, I need to set the status of legacy `1LOD` and `2LOD` fields to **Inactive** on the **Control Result** module. This ensures the system reflects the single-field reporting standard adopted in 2024 and prompts users to transition legacy reports to the new `Line of Defense` field.

---

### Technical Requirements

1. **Field Status Update:**
* Update the status of `1LOD` and `2LOD` fields to **Inactive** within the field configuration/dictionary.


2. **User Notification:**
* Distribute a communication to users/report owners regarding the deactivation.
* Provide instructions for updating existing reports to utilize the consolidated `Line of Defense` field.



---

### Acceptance Criteria (AC)

| ID | Criteria | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **AC 1** | **Field Inactivation** | Legacy fields `1LOD` and `2LOD` are marked as **Inactive** in the system configuration. |
| **AC 2** | **System Enforcement** | Inactive fields are verified as no longer available for selection in new reports or form layouts. |
| **AC 3** | **User Awareness** | Communication sent to stakeholders identifying that legacy reports using these fields must be updated to the new `Line of Defense` field. |

---

### Impact Analysis: Reporting

* **Existing Reports:** Reports currently filtered by or grouped by the legacy fields will likely break or return empty results once the fields are inactive.
* **Remediation:** Users must manually swap the old fields for the new `Line of Defense` field in their saved reports.

**Would you like me to draft a concise communication template you can send to the users explaining how to update their reports?**
