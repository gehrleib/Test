*Problem Statement:*
The current placement of the *Local Regulatory Environment Questionnaire* (LREQ) section on the *Assessable Unit* and *Assessable Unit Snapshot* pages does not align with the logical workflow. This can cause user confusion and require additional navigation to find related information, impacting efficiency.

*Solution:*
To improve user experience and streamline the workflow, the *LREQ* section will be moved to be immediately after the *Baseline Prioritization Questionnaire* (BPQ) section on both the *Assessable Unit* and *Assessable Unit Snapshot* objects.

h3. Acceptance Criteria

* On the *Assessable Unit* page, the *LREQ* section is displayed directly below the *BPQ* section.
* On the *Assessable Unit Snapshot* page, the *LREQ* section is displayed directly below the *BPQ* section.
* The content and functionality within both the *BPQ* and *LREQ* sections remain unchanged after the move.
* The system's performance is not negatively impacted by this change in display order.
