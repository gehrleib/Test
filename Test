As the sole developer and lead for the RegComp (RCM) Archer platform this year, my focus was on delivering two high-impact modernization projects while ensuring operational excellence through continuous business-as-usual support. I was responsible for the full lifecycle of all development, enhancements, and operational stability.

CUBE Project Leadership & Delivery: I successfully delivered the CUBE project, a critical initiative to replace our legacy regulatory content source (Norton Rose). I architected a new standalone module, developed a robust Python script for automated API integration with a custom-built redline comparison feature, and overhauled the user experience by consolidating five dashboards into a single, dynamic, role-based interface. A significant challenge of this project was the constant turnover within the partner regulatory content team, which led to frequently changing requirements, dates, and expectations. I successfully navigated this instability by maintaining clear communication and adapting the development plan, which was crucial in keeping the project on track and meeting all our IT deadlines without sacrificing quality.

Enterprise Issue Management (EIM) Integration: I led the RCM Archer integration for the enterprise-wide migration to the new EIM system. I addressed a major process gap by designing and building a separate module for "non-issue exceptions"â€”items that did not meet EIM criteria. This solution enabled the clean and safe archival of our legacy issue management system. Critically, I re-engineered the integration with our risk assessment process, ensuring that new high-severity issues from EIM automatically and accurately update residual risk scores, thereby maintaining the integrity of our overall risk posture.

Continuous Improvement & Platform Ownership (BAU): Beyond major projects, I managed all business-as-usual activities for the platform. This involved personally delivering numerous stakeholder-requested enhancements to improve workflow efficiency and user experience. I also served as the primary point of contact for responsive production support, promptly resolving ad-hoc technical issues and compliance queries to ensure minimal disruption to business operations.
