This year, my work was centered on leading two high-impact modernization projects while ensuring operational excellence through continuous business-as-usual support.

CUBE Project Leadership & Delivery: As the sole developer and lead, I successfully delivered the CUBE project, a critical initiative to replace our legacy regulatory content source (Norton Rose). My key contributions included architecting a new standalone Archer module to ingest the data without impacting production systems and developing a robust Python script for automated daily API integration. A key innovation in this script was a custom-built redline comparison feature, which highlights content changes for users and significantly reduces manual review time. I also overhauled the user experience by consolidating five dashboards into a single, dynamic, role-based interface and led the complex data migration by devising a "grouping" strategy to navigate technical limitations in the source API, guiding the business on its implementation.

Enterprise Issue Management (EIM) Integration: I played a key role in the enterprise-wide migration to the new EIM system. I addressed a major process gap by designing and building a separate module for "non-issue exceptions"â€”items that did not meet EIM criteria. This solution enabled the clean and safe archival of our legacy issue management system. Critically, I re-engineered the integration with our risk assessment process, ensuring that new high-severity issues from EIM automatically and accurately update residual risk scores, thereby maintaining the integrity of our overall risk posture.

Continuous Improvement & Support (BAU): Beyond major projects, I managed all business-as-usual activities, focusing on continuous improvement and platform stability. This involved delivering numerous stakeholder-requested enhancements to improve workflow efficiency and user experience. I also provided responsive production support to promptly resolve ad-hoc technical issues and compliance queries, ensuring minimal disruption to business operations.
